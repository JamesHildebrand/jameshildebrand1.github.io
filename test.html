<p1 class="dotted"><div>Hook: Andy & Akiva, T-Pain, & All]
I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat)
I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat)
Everybody look at me, 'cause I'm sailing on a boat (sailing on a boat)
I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat)
I'm on a boat
Take a good, hard look at the motherfucking boat, yeah

[Verse 1: Andy, Akiva, & T-Pain]
I'm on a boat, motherfucker, take a look at me
Straight floating on a boat on the deep blue sea (yeah, yeah)
Busting five knots, wind whipping out my coat
You can't stop me, motherfucker, 'cause I'm on a boat
Take a picture, trick (trick); I'm on a boat, bitch (bitch)
We drinking Santana champ, cause it's so crisp (crisp)
I got my swim trunks, and my flippie-floppies
I'm flipping burgers, you at Kinko's straight flippin' copies
I'm riding on a dolphin, doing flips and shit (yeah)
The dolphin's splashing, getting everybody all wet (oh)
But this ain't Seaworld, this as real as it gets (yeah, yeah)
I'm on a boat, motherfucker, don't you ever forget
I'm on a boat, and it's going fast, and
I got a nautical themed pashmina afghan
I'm the king of the world, on a boat like Leo
If you're on the shore, then you're sho' not me-oh

[Refrain: Andy]
Get the fuck up, this boat is real!

[Verse 2: Andy, Akiva, & T-Pain]
Fuck land, I'm on a boat, motherfucker (motherfucker)
Fuck trees, I climb buoys, motherfucker (motherfucker)
I'm on the deck with my boys, motherfucker (ayy)
This boat engine make noise, motherfucker
Hey, ma, if you could see me now (see me now)
Arms spread wide on the starboard bow (starboard bow)
Gonna fly this boat to the moon somehow (moon somehow)
Like Kevin Garnett, anything is possible

[Bridge: T-Pain & Andy]
Yeah, never thought I'd be on a boat (let's go)
It's a big, blue, watery road (yeah)
Poseidon, look at me, oh (all hands on deck)
Never thought I'd see the day
When a big boat coming my way
Believe me when I say
I did a mermaid, whoah

[Hook: Andy & Akiva]
I'm on a boat
I'm on a boat
Everybody look at me, 'cause I'm sailing on a boat
I'm on a boat
I'm on a boat
Take a good, hard look at the boat</p1></div>
